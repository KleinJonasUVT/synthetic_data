# Synthetic Data Generation for Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis using AI

## Overview

This project automates the process of filling out choice-based conjoint (CBC) surveys using synthetic data generated by the OpenAI GPT-4o model. It simulates user responses based on pre-defined demographic attributes (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) stored in a CSV file, and uses OpenAI's API to generate survey answers. This allows for the creation of synthetic datasets for consumer preference studies without the need for extensive real-world data collection.

Key features include:
- Automatic screenshot capture while scrolling through the survey.
- Stitching of captured screenshots into a single image.
- Automated answering of both multiple-choice and open-ended questions using AI.
- Summary of responses using OpenAI GPT-4o.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you will need to install the required dependencies and have the necessary input data. The `requirements.txt` file contains all the Python packages you need to install, and the `user_data.csv` file contains the user data used to fill the surveys.

### `requirements.txt`
```pandas 
selenium 
webdriver-manager 
openai 
Pillow 
requests
```

### `user_data.csv`

A sample `user_data.csv` is available in the repository. It should have the following columns:

| Age | Sex | Country_of_birth | Ethnicity | Country_of_residence | Student_status | Employment_status |
|-----|-----|------------------|-----------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 25  | M   | Germany          | White     | Germany              | Yes            | Employed          |

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```git clone <repository-url>```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```


3. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**:
    You will need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```export API_survey=<your-openai-api-key>```


4. **Place User Data**:
    Ensure that the `user_data.csv` file is located in the root directory of the repository.

5. **Run the Script**:
    Execute the script to start filling out surveys based on the user data:
    ```python main.py```


    The script will automatically launch a Chrome browser, fill out the survey, and generate screenshots and logs. After each user survey is completed, the browser will close and the next user's survey will begin.

    **Note**: If using this in a headless environment, modify the Chrome options to run Chrome in headless mode.

6. **Review Logs and Outputs**:
    Screenshots of the survey pages and responses will be saved in the `screenshots/` directory. Logs of the process will be available in the console.
